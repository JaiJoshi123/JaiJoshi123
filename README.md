## Hey there! [Jai Joshi](https://jaijoshi123.github.io/) here <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" height="20px">

I am currently a **Second-Year** Master's student at **Georgia Institute of Technology** (May 2025 Grad), pursuing my **Master of Science** in **Computer Science**. 

A dedicated developer with a rapid learning curve who is looking to broaden his skill set. I am a 💻Full-stack developer, 📱Mobile-App Developer, 🤖AI/ML & Blockchain enthusiast and a 🎻part-time guitarist ;)

I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning hold enormous promise in this regard. My undergraduate work mainly included leveraging neuromorphic computing and data-driven tools to address real-world issues.

Throughout my academic journey, I have continually broadened my knowledge through an eclectic approach, including academic subjects, internships, research under professors, and independent projects. My extracurricular activities have provided me with essential leadership and communication skills.
